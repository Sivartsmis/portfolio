                        <h3>Work Experience: </h3>
                        <p class="purpose-statement">
                        I spent 12 years working in various roles in the automotive industry and financial industry. The majority of my career was spent in the former, I worked for 12 years as a business analyst and continual improvement expert culminating in a role as Supervisor of Continual Improvement. My responsibilities ranged from leading continual improvement projects and leading the internal audit program for the entire North American region which led me to spend time traveling to our Detroit Michigan and Harrisburg Pennsylvania locations multiple times a year.

                        <p class="purpose-statement">
                        I eventually resigned from this position to pursue a career change to the financial industry to bolster my knowledge working with data. I began to work as a Data Governance analyst but transitioned back into a business analyst role shortly after joining the new company. During this time, I increased my knowledge by learning more about the financial industry, I learned new tools, and of course I learned more about handling and managing data. I learned about Life Insurance and Annuity products, new tools such as Jupyter Notebooks and DataIku, and Data Governance concepts such as SMART data practices, security principles, etc.

                        <p class="purpose-statement">
                            Outside of my professional life, I lead a relatively quiet life with my spouse and pets. Currently, we have two elderly pets – a dog and a cat, both 10+ years of age. My favorite afterwork activities include playing video games, weightlifting, and upskilling where I can by taking courses to help me both professionally and personally.

                        <p class="purpose-statement">
                            I am an avid football fan and die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan. I have followed the Eagles ever since I was a child and the fandom has stuck. My love for football led me to join a few Fantasy Football leagues – even starting my own to share this activity with my friends and family. I find that Fantasy Football is the perfect combination of my love for football and data as I get to geek out on Football Stats and give myself an excuse to watch as many games as possible during the NFL Season.
